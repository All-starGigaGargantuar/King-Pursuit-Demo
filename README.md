# King-Pursuit-Demo
Test Demo of King's Pursuit. Will be updated in the future.

Controls:

You move using your mouse. Click on the King or any Black Pieces to select and move them

Press Tab to enable fullscreen

Press M to partially mute the game (mutes the background music and half of the sound effects)

Press T to enable Turns Hacks (basically being able to move for unlimited amounts of turns in a row with the drawback of the opponent gaining that many additional turns as soon as you turn off the hack)

Press the space bar to skip 1 turn or hold Alt to skip multiple turns

There will be an AI for you to play against in the future. For now, it's just you playing against yourself. More gimmicks will be added to make the games less boring.
